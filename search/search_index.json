for generating a statement of knowledge.\n      The human may utilize computationally generated information as evidence for\n      the resulting knowledge,  but the human is the one who ultimately

tool, that is  responsible\n      for generating a statement of knowledge. Human contribution  to the knowledge\n      creation process ends with the definition and coding of algorithms or analysis\n      pipelines that get executed by the automated agent.\n  data_analysis_pipeline:\n    text: data_analysis_pipeline\n    description: An automated agent that executes an analysis workflow over data and  reports\n      the direct results of the analysis. These typically report  statistical associations/correlations\n      between variables in the input dataset, and do not interpret/infer broader conclusions\n      from associations the analysis reveals in the data.\n    is_a: automated_agent\n    notes:\n    - If an analysis pipeline includes any rules for generating broader  conclusions\n      based on the dataset-specific statistical correlations it calculates (e.g. create\n      a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals a  drug-disease correlation in the\n      data with statistical scores that meet a  certain threshold) - we would consider\n      this agent to be a Computational Model rather than just a Data Analysis Pipeline.\n  computational_model:\n    text: computational_model\n    description: An automated agent that generates knowledge statements (typically\n      predictions) based on rules/logic explicitly encoded in an algorithm (e.g. heuristic\n      models, supervised classifiers), or learned from patterns  observed in data\n      (e.g. ML models, unsupervised classifiers).\n    is_a: automated_agent\n    notes:\n    - The bar is quite low relatively for what is considered to be a  \u2018computational\n      model\u2019 by our definition. Even agents/tools that apply  simple rules or logic\n      to the output of an ingest or analysis pipeline to allow for a stronger or more\n      general conclusion to be stated can  qualify an agent as a model. For example,\n      an ingest pipeline that applies rules to its ingest of  clinical trials data\n      to create a 'treats' prediction edge when the  source reports a drug to be in\n      phase 2 or 3 trials represents a computational model because it is automatically\n      drawing a stronger conclusion than the source reports, based on logic encoded\n      in the ingest pipeline. Similarly, a data analysis pipeline that is extended\n      with rules to  automatically generate broader conclusions based on dataset-specific\n      statistical correlations (e.g. create a 'treats' edge when the analysis reveals\n      a drug-disease correlation in the data with statistical scores  that meet a\n      certain threshold), would also qualify as a computational  model by our definition.\n  text_mining_agent:\n    text: text_mining_agent\n    description: An automated agent that uses Natural Language Processing to recognize\n      concepts and/or relationships in text, and report them using formally encoded\n      semantics (e.g. as an edge in a knowledge graph).\n    is_a: automated_agent\n    notes:\n    - The original statement in the source text is typically made by a human /  manual\n      agent, but if a specific encoding of this knowledge is produced by a text-mining\n      tool, it has an agent_type of 'text_mining_agent'. Examples of text mining agents\n      include SemmedDB, and the Translator Text-Mining Knowledge Provider. Note that\n      text-mining tools are prone to erroneous interpretation of  concepts and relationships,\n      and can fail to provide important details  about the context in which the original\n      knowledge was reported - so users should always consult the source text for\n      a text-mined statement to assess its veracity and relevance.\n  image_processing_agent:\n    text: image_processing_agent\n    description: An automated agent that processes images to generate textual statements\n      of  knowledge derived from the image and/or expressed in text the image  depicts\n      (e.g. via OCR).\n    is_a: automated_agent\n  manual_validation_of_automated_agent:\n    text: manual_validation_of_automated_agent\n    description: A human agent reviews and validates/approves the veracity of knowledge  that\n      is initially generated by an automated agent.\n    notes:\n    - This term applies when a human was only involved in evaluating the veracity\n      of a knowledge statement that was generated by an automated agent. It is  important\n      to indicate when such manual review has occurred, because it can give a user\n      more confidence in an automated statement.\n  not_provided:\n    text: not_provided\n

In practice, these will primarily be entailments based on logic encoded\n      in ontologies.

Their\n      scope is limited tp the cohort/dataset interrogated in the analysis, and they\n      do not make broader claims or draw  more meaningful conclusions about the domain\n      of discourse. Note however that such Statistical  Associations can be used as\n      evidence to support a more pointed/precise Prediction or Assertion  of knowledge.\n      For example, e.g. a Statistical Association between 'Metformin Prescription'\n      and 'Diabetes Diagnosis' in EHR records could support a Prediction that 'Metformin\n      treats Diabetes',  or 'Metformin causes Diabetes'. This 'treats' edge may have\n      a knowledge_level of 'Prediction',  but the provider could use the 'evidence_type'\n      edge property to indicate that this prediction is  based on a 'Statistical Association'.\n      Because Statistical Associations directly report analysis-specific  results,\n      we can consider them to be inherently true statements, whose broader utility\n      is dependent on  subsequent generalization of the reported result to a broader\n      population, and/or interpretation of the  result as support for a more meaningful\n      statements about the domain of discourse.\n  observation:\n    text: observation\n    description: A statement reporting (and possibly quantifying) a phenomenon that\n      was observed to occur -  absent any analysis or interpretation that generates\n      a statistical association or supports a broader conclusion or inference.\n    notes:\n    - An observation that \"56362 people self-reported taking melatonin to treat migraines\"\n      is agnostic to whether melatonin is an effective or approved treatment - it\n      only claims that it was taken for this purpose. Such observations, however,\n      may be used as the basis for predicting that a  drug may be efficacious against\n      a disease.\n  not_provided:\n    text: not_provided\n    description: The knowledge level is not provided, typically because it cannot\n      be determined from available. information.\n    notes:\n    - This term is most often applied for text-mined edges, as NLP tools are typically\n      not able to detect a specific knowledge level for the concept relationships\n      they extract (e.g. whether the author  was predicting or asserting a relationship,\n      or merely observed it to occur).\n\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"MatrixDiseaseList/","title":"None (schema class)","text":"<p>A list of diseases.</p> <p>URI:
